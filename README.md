# A-Machine-Learning-Blog-Series
<p>This is a blog series about what I learned in Machine Learning field</p>

# Description
<p>I decide to write a series blog about what I learned about the Machine Learning in order to memorize the key algorithms and the principles. Gaining new insight through reviewing old materials is also the reason why I prefer to write a series blog. I wonâ€™t analyze the math equations in detail except it is really hard to understand. For some sections, I may add some projects I did.</p>

<p>What invokes in the series:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/YuanGao0317/A-Machine-Learning-Blog-Series/blob/master/Blog/1%20Univariate%20Linear%20Regression.pdf">Univariate Linear Regression</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/YuanGao0317/A-Machine-Learning-Blog-Series/blob/master/Blog/2%20Multivariate%20Linear%20Regression.pdf">Multivariate Linear Regression</a></li>
</ul>
